       "\n",
       "**Spring Boot 4.0 vs. Spring Boot 3.5: Key Differences**\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1. Java Version Support\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Spring Boot 4.0**: Supports Java 11, Java 16, and Java 17 as the default JVM version.\n",
       "\t+ Note: While other JVM versions might be available through the `spring-boot-starter-jdk` module, they are not recommended for production use.\n",
       "* **Spring Boot 3.5**: Supports Java 8, Java 11, Java 14, Java 15, and Java 16 as the default JVM version.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. Tomcat/Server Connection**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Spring Boot 4.0**:\n",
       "\t+ Defaulted to using an embedded, secure, and more efficient Tomcat instance (`spring-boot-starter-tomcat-dev` was replaced with `spring-boot-starter-web-server-embedded-tomcat`). Requires Java 11 or higher.\n",
       "\t+ Tomcat's server-side connections are now properly secured and the connection is restricted by default. The new version expects a `javax/sql/JDBC` license instead of relying on an unrestricted license. It also introduced several performance upgrades over previous versions (e.g., improved support for AIO connections).\n",
       "* **Spring Boot 3.5**:\n",
       "\t+ Defaulted to using an embedded, unsecured Tomcat instance (`spring-boot-starter-tomcat-dev`).\n",
       "\t+ No changes were made compared with the previous version.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. Server Configuration and Connection Settings\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Spring Boot 4.0**:\n",
       "\t+ The `server.address`, `server.ssl`, `server.ssl.keystore.location`, and similar configuration options have been removed, as they will default to specific values based on the module used (e.g., embedded servers).\n",
       "\t+ These defaults require Java 11 or higher.\n",
       "* **Spring Boot 3.5**:\n",
       "\t+ Configuration options like `server.address` and others are preserved; however, some settings (like configuring a keystore location) might still be confusing for users of a multi-project build.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4. Additional Modules and Dependencies\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Spring Boot 4.0**:\n",
       "\t+ Several new sub-modules were introduced to separate components from the main starter module.\n",
       "\t+ Some deprecated sub-modes and methods have been removed.\n",
       "\t+ Performance upgrades were achieved by updating dependencies like Apache Commons and Jackson, which provide better memory handling in multi-threaded applications.\n",
       "* **Spring Boot 3.5** (No significant changes.)\n",
       "\n",
       "### 5. Additional Features\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Spring Boot 4.0:**\n",
       "    *   Added support for JavaFX on a standalone server environment using the new `spring-boot-starter-jfx-server`.\n",
       "    *   The server supports AIO, which has been a long-awaited feature by many Spring developer and helps improve performance in async or single-threaded applications.\n",
       "*   **Spring Boot 3.5:**\n",
       "    *   No additional features were announced.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 6. Security\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Spring Boot 4.0**:\n",
       "   + Added a flag for enabling application-level security features, like SSL/TLS and mutual authentication.\n",
       "   + Support for Spring Security `@SpringBootApplication` has changed; it's available (as always) at the top level or in a child class implementing this annotation.\n",
       "*   **Spring Boot 3.5**:\n",
       "   * No changes to Spring Security modules.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Note:\n",
       "\n",
       "While Spring Boot 4.0 and Spring Boot 3.5 have distinct differences, their new capabilities mean many improvements when transitioning a Java application built using the `spring-boot-starter-parent` POM template to the newer version (e.g., performance improvements)."
